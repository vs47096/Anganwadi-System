# Anganwadi-System
This project comprises of two Android Applications and a website. Two separate Android Applications are for Helper and Supervisor respectively. By means of online system, every action in Anganwadi will be transparent and it will also help to keep track and manage records related to stock, medical treatments and helper actions.

In the Supervisor Android Application, supervisor will login by entering the credentials provided by the administrator which will then display the home screen. Some screenshots of this procedure are shown here:
